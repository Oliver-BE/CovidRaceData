The `CovidRaceData` package contains two data sets on the COVID-19
pandemic in the US by race/ethnicity. More specifically, it has data for
the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths by race/ethnicity for each
state. The raw data set (which is titled `covid_race_data_raw` in this
package) was obtained from [The COVID Tracking
Project](https://covidtracking.com/race/about#download-the-data) and the
`aggregated_covid_race_df` contains information on the percent of
cases/deaths by race/ethnicity vs.Â the percent of the population that
each race/ethnicity compose in the US.
