Description: This package contains two data sets on the COVID-19 pandemic in the US by race/ethnicity (as of 10/07/2020). More specifically, it has data for the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths by race/ethnicity for each state. The raw data set (which is titled `covid_race_data_raw` in this package) was obtained from The COVID Tracking Project (https://covidtracking.com/race/about#download-the-data) and the `aggregated_covid_race_df` contains information on the percent of cases/deaths by race/ethnicity vs. the percent of the population that each race/ethnicity composes in the US.
